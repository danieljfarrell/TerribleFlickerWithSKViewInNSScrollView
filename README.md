# TerribleFlickerWithSKViewInNSScrollView
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29166394/terrible-flicker-when-using-skview-in-nsscrollview

* Terrible flicker when scrolling
* Terrible flicker when resizing the window
* The shape is a circle, however, the aspect ratio is getting all messed up.

I'm running this on a MacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012), OS X 10.10.2; could be device specific.
